# Telegram Login App

A Next.js application that demonstrates secure authentication using Telegram Login Widget. This app allows users to quickly sign in using their Telegram account without the need for traditional username/password credentials.

## Features

- üîê Secure authentication using Telegram Login Widget
- ‚ö° Fast and responsive Next.js application
- üîÑ Automatic session management
- üé® Clean and modern UI using Geist font
- üì± Mobile-responsive design

## Getting Started

1. First, obtain your Telegram API credentials:
   - Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth)
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Click on 'API development tools'
   - Create a new application if you haven't already
   - You will receive your `api_id` and `api_hash`
   - Save these credentials securely

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .venv.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in your Telegram API credentials in the `.env.local` file:
   - `TELEGRAM_API_ID`: Your API ID from my.telegram.org
   - `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`: Your API Hash from my.telegram.org

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How It Works

The application implements Telegram's Login Widget to provide a seamless authentication experience. When users click the Telegram login button, they can authorize the application using their Telegram account. The app verifies the authentication data on the server side to ensure security.
